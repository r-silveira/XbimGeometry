# Xbim.Geometry.Dependencies

This project / package is internal to the build of the GE service and is never deployed.

The sole purpose is to consolidate dependencies in a CSharp SDK project to be used by the C++/CLI 
Xbim.Geometry.Engine projects, which are not SDK projects and have poor support for nuget etc
